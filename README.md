Introduction: This is the source code for the backend component for the Waste Not project. Our backend tech application was written in Java play which interacted with a mysql database. In addition, we wrote a series of scripts which handled and simulated our data, and deployed it to our several applications. This project includes a suite of restful api's for managing all of our aggregated data, populating our elastic search instance, and generating all of our data into a readable format for our machine learning module. 
 
 Requirements: You must install Java 1.8, Python 2.x, MySQL 1.5.3, and Play 1.3.1
